There are a number of places you can buy your domain.

Cloudflare also can help you buy a domain, but only limited to certain TLD (e.g. .com, .io). If you'd like more option, I usually purchase from Namecheap. In this step we will proceed with Namecheap.

<ImagePreview

  previewSrc="/module-2/deploy/step-4_01.png"
  alt="Result of ssh"
/>

Choosing Namecheap also help you understand how to configure a custom nameserver.

1. Head over to [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/)
2. Find any cheap domain, I would suggest to buy one for your very first landing page as a portfolio.
3. Done!

Once you've purchased, you might be confuse what to do next.

If you click **Manage** on the Namecheap Dashboard, for your domain you've just bought, you can see there's a column for **Nameservers**.

Just take note of it, we will first go to Cloudflare again.
