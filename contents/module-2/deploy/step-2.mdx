In your server where you have installed Kamal Proxy, we will install cloudflared (link to cloudflared)

This also means you will need an account with Cloudflare. We will use the free version, and it will suffice for our homelab.

Let us break down what we need to do.

1. Sign up for Cloudflare (Free)
2. Purchase a domain with Namecheap (get the cheapest one)
3. Propogating nameserver from Namecheap to Cloudflare
4. Creating tunnel and configure
5. Done!

It may seems a lot, but most of these you only need to perform one. For your next project, it is just step 4 and 5 only!

Let us walk through each of these steps.
