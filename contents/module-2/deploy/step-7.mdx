import ImagePreview from "@/components/image-preview";

Here, we will only need to change our `proxy.host`.

In my case, I am changing this to `zafranudin.my`. Most of the other config can remain the same.

Here's a sample from my Kamal config.

<ImagePreview
  originalSrc="/module-2/deploy/step-7_01.png"
  previewSrc="/module-2/deploy/step-7_01.png"
  alt="Result of ssh"
/>

Now, simply run deploy command.

```
kamal deploy
```

Since we already set up our Kamal in previous lesson, here we only need to run `deploy` only.
