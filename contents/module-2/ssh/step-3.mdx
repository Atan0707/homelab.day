import Image from "next/image";
import ImagePreview from "@/components/image-preview";

Now that you've learned the basic, let us execute this command:

```
ip a
```

It will print some fancy hacker-like output, but we just want to see what is our IP Address.

<ImagePreview
  previewSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-2_01.png"
  originalSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-2_01.png"
  alt="Result of ip a command"
/>

In this case, my IP Address is `192.168.178.42`. To make sure it is a valid IP, try to ping it. It's like shouting "ping" and someone will reply "pong".

```bash
ping 192.168.178.42
```

It will then output the 'pong' part.

<ImagePreview
  previewSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-2_02.png"
  originalSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-2_02.png"
  alt="Result of ping"
/>

Yes, it is safe for me to show you this IP, as it is my local address. Only the network within my house can access this system.

To stop the endless output from the 'pong', simply press `CTRL + C` on your keyboard.
