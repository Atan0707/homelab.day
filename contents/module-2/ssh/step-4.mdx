Here comes the fun part.

**Take note of your Homelab IP address earlier.**

Write it on notepad or something, we will need it now.

Afterwards:

1. Disconnect the monitor from your Homelab Server. Yes, remove that HDMI cable.
2. Unplug your keyboard as well from the Homelab.

Your homelab should now only have:

- LAN cable or WIFI module connected
- Power supply (of course)
