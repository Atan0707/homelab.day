We will learn a little bit of networking in this module.

Connect your Homelab to a monitor and keyboard. We will perform some basic command in the command line interface (CLI).

### Figuring out the CLI

If this is the first time you're facing a CLI, do not worry. It accepts keyboard input, only without mouse.

For extra visual, I will share some screenshot as well to aid you.

Before anything, you should log into the server. It will prompt for your username and password, just provide them.

For security, during writing the password, it won't show any dot, asterisk or anything. Continue writing your password as usual.

### Understanding this guide

Throughout this tutorial, if you see this window below, it means you have to type `ip a` in your terminal CLI, and press ENTER.

```
ip a
```

If there's a comment, it is just to aid with understanding what the command does. It won't have any effect whatsoever.

```bash
# This is a comment, and terminal won't execute it
ip a
```

In the above case, only the `ip a` command should be executed.
