Now, let's head to your Personal PC (notice the diagram now switched to Personal PC).

I've also removed the internet from the diagram to not confuse us.

What we are about to do, is exactly running without internet.

All are via the router or your local network!

### Connect via SSH

Just like how we connect via the monitor earlier (username, password), we now can do the same via your Personal PC.

Run this command, and replace your `<ip address>` with your own IP Address.

```bash
ping <your_homelab_ip>
```

You should see the same output like earlier. This mean your Personal PC is connected to the Homelab Server!

Next, let's log into that Homelab server.

```
ssh <your_username>@<your_homelab_ip>
```

For example, in my case, it will be:

```
ssh zafranudin-demo@192.168.178.42
```

<ImagePreview
  previewSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-5_01.png"
  originalSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-5_01.png"
  alt="Result of ssh"
/>

Since this is the first time we are connecting to it, it will ask us to verify.

Just type `yes` and press enter.

And just like that, you are now connected to your Homelab!

No monitor, no keyboard, just power supply and Ethernet/Wifi connection!

  previewSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-5_02.png"
  originalSrc="/module-2/ssh/step-5_02.png"
  alt="Result of ssh"
/>

I still get excited everytime I see this output. It is like a magic...

Oh yeah, the diagram is updated too. Both are now green!
