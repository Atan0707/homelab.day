Kamal provided a good resource on how to set it up.

I recommend for you to use the recommended `ruby` installation.

[Install Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/installation/)

This is done on your **Personal Computer**.

Verify everything is installed correctly, by:

```bash
kamal version
```

It should output its latest version.

Afterwards, setup Docker Hub account. We will host our Docker images here and use the public free images.

### Initiating Kamal

Now that the gem is installed, you can now begin the init setup.

```bash
kamal init
```

This will add a bunch of files, but we should focus on `config/deploy.yml`.

Replace everything accordingly as follow:

This can be confusing, I know, but it's pretty simple as follow:

1. If you do not have a domain, don't worry, we will configure in a separate learning module.
2. `servers.web` is the **IP Address of your homelab**. Still remember?
3. `registry.username` is your Docker username earlier.
4. `image` is the docker registry repository from the previous step.
   - Mine is `zafranudindev/demo-homelab-day`.
   - Replace the `<replace_me>` with yours.
5. `proxy.host` take note of this, even if you haven't buy any domain yet. See the end of tutorial later for why.

Edit `config/deploy.yml`.

```yml
# Name of your application. Used to uniquely configure containers.
service: demo-homelab-day

# the image name to be hosted in the registry
image: <replace_me>/demo-homelab-day

servers:
  # your homelab local network, e.g 172.168.0.5
  web:
    - 172.168.0.5

proxy:
  ssl: false
  # don't  change for now, you'll see by the end of tutorial
  host: homelab.my-local-network.com
  app_port: 5000
  forward_headers: true
  healthcheck:
    path: "/"

registry:
  # change to your docker username
  username: <change_me>
  password:
    - KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD

builder:
  arch: amd64
```

### Run Kamal setup

With everything in place, let us start the setup!

```
export KAMAL_REGISTRY_PASSWORD=<your_docker_password_earlier>
kamal setup
```

<ImagePreview
  originalSrc="/module-2/kamal/step-4_01.png"
  previewSrc="/module-2/kamal/step-4_01.png"
  alt="Result of ssh"
/>

You will face an error, that is OK and intended. Let us proceed to the next step!
