To get started, let us fork my clone website I built for you.

[Github demo.homelab.day](https://github.com/Xavier-IV/demo.homelab.day)

With this repo, our goal is to have a landing page for your Homelab!

1. **Fork** the repo to your own Github repository.
2. Clone the repo after you **forked it**.

_While you're at it, please star <Star className="inline fill-yellow-400 text-yellow-400 border-orange-900" /> the repo too (thank you!)_

Remember, all this is done in your **Personal Computer**. The reason to fork is so that you can customize that landing page to your own style, it is totally yours!

E.g.

```
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/demo.homelab.day.git
```

Where `<your_username>` is your Github account username.

After succesfully cloned, we will now begin with our Kamal setup.
