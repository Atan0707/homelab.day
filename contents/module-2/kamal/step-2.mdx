To get started, let us fork my clone website I built for you.

[Clone demo.homelab.day](https://github.com/Xavier-IV/demo.homelab.day)

In the Github repository, you can just fork it.

With this repo, our goal is to have a landing page for your Homelab!

1. Fork the repo to your own Github repository.
2. Clone the repo after you forked it.

Remember, all this is done in your **Personal Computer**.

E.g.

```
git clone git@github.com:<your_username>/demo.homelab.day.git
```

Where `<your_username>` is your Github account username.

After succesfully cloned, we will now begin with our Kamal setup.
