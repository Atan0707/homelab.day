In this step, we will setup Kamal and also register for free Docker Hub account.

1. Install Kamal
2. Registry Docker Hub
3. Create Docker token

### 1. Install Kamal

Kamal provided a good resource on how to set it up.

I recommend for you to use the recommended `ruby` installation.

[Install Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/docs/installation/)

This is done on your **Personal Computer**.

Verify everything is installed correctly, by:

```bash
kamal version
```

It should output its latest version.

Afterwards, setup Docker Hub account. We will host our Docker images here and use the public free images.

### 2. Register Free Docker Hub Account

Head over to hub.docker.com, and register your account (if you have not one).

[Register in Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com)

Once registered, create a new public repository.

[Create New Repository](https://hub.docker.com/repository/create)

Take note of the Repository Name, you will need it later. For example, mine is `zafranudindev/demo-homelab-day`.

### 3. Get your Docker token

This step is simply to let Kamal upload an image for you automatically.

Head over to:

1. Account Setting [Go to](https://app.docker.com/settings)
2. Under **Security > Personal access tokens**, click **Generate new token**.

   - Set description as: Kamal Local
   - Access permissions: "Read, Write, Delete"

3. Take note of this token, and store it safely.

Now that the hard part is done, let us proceed for the fun part!
