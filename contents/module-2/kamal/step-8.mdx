import Graduated from "@/components/graduated";
import { students } from "./graduated.ts";

That was a lot, but totally worth it!

Obviously some part of the doc needs a bit of proof reading, but I am fully satisfied with what we have achieved.

If you're satisifed and it works for you, feel free to join the graduation!
