import Alert from "@/components/alert.tsx";
import { Usb } from "lucide-react";

In this step, we will setup a USB stick that will install our server operating system.

Just consider it to be like installing Windows 11 into a new computer.

### Begin Preparation

You will need in this step:

1. USB Stick, minimum 16GB <Usb className="inline border rounded-md px-0.5"/>
2. Keyboard
3. External Monitor (just this step)
4. (Personal Computer) to configure the USB Stick to be bootable.

In this step, our goal is to install Ubuntu Server operating system, into our small USB Stick. Yep.

Depending on your Personal Computer operating system, follow any of this relevant steps.
