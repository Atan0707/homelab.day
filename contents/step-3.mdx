title: "Step 2: Prepare Bootable USB"

import Alert from "@/components/alert.tsx";
import { Usb } from "lucide-react";

In this step, we will setup a USB stick that will install our server operating system.

Just consider it to be like installing Windows 11 into a new computer.

### Begin Preparation

You will need in this step:

1. USB Stick, minimum 16GB <Usb className="inline border rounded-md px-0.5"/>
2. Keyboard
3. External Monitor (just this step)
4. (Personal Computer) to configure the USB Stick to be bootable.

For our server, I would suggest for you to use headless server. It is a server that does not have any Graphical User Interface (GUI), except plain simple terminal. GUI would usually consume resources, and since this is a server, you would rarely use the GUI but most of the time we will SSH into the server instead via terminal.

You can connect your homelab system via an HDMI display port for initial setup. Afterwards, we can totally remove the HDMI and connect via LAN network.

### What's now?

By now, you should have a bootable USB device. Not sure what it does? We will now head over to the next step!

Notice how we have not touch anything on our homelab server yet.
