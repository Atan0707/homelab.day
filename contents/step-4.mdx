import { Usb } from "lucide-react";

Now, you can disconnect your USB from your Personal PC.

The same USB device, you will now connect this to your Homelab (finally!)

But instead of the normal boot or start up, we will do something different. With the USB device connected to Homelab, we should now boot into BIOS.

Afterward, use the BIOS to boot from the USB device.

Yes, you're not going to a believe that a whole Operating System is inside that tiny USB!

### Caveat

Different operating system boot into USB differently. Some would need to press certain F1, F2, F^ pattern on the keyboard. Some automatically boot from the USB.

You can quickly google: **"\<hardware\> boot from USB ISO"**

...where \<hardware\> is your Homelab server, such as Lenovo Thinkcentre, Raspberry PI, etc.

When properly executed, you will boot into the Ubuntu Server installation setup.

Once you can see the installer, let's head to the next step!
