import Graduated from "@/components/graduated";
import { students } from "./graduated.ts";

That's it!

Give yourself a pat on the head, as this is a journey not many willing to take.

Obviously, there's more to setup than this. But it will be in a separate upcoming topic I'm writing.

- Connecting from Personal PC to Homelab within local network
- Hosting your very first website to the internet (yay!) with Docker
- Connecting from anywhere in the world, into your Homelab

Stay tuned and enjoy your success!

_p/s: Feel free to format the USB again, you won't use it anymore for our tutorials._
