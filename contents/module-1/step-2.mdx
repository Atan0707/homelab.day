You will need to have this tools and device to proceed.

### Prerequisites

- (Homelab) An unused computer to be used as server
  - It must have an Ethernet network interface (LAN) or WIFI module.
  - It must have a USB Port
- (Personal Computer) Secondary computer to install server ISO image
- Internet connection
- USB device, min 4 GB
- Monitor
- Keyboard

### 1. Choose Your Hardware

For this tutorial, the homelab hardware can be as small as Raspberry Pi. Even with minimum spec, we can still get something out of it.

Ideally a system with more than 4GB of ram can perform better since we will be running Docker Engine, but hey, we all must start somewhere. Just grab any unused compute hiding under your bed.

### 2. Download the Operating System

We will use headless Ubuntu Server as the Operating System installed.

It is minimal, without UI (except terminal). Don't be afraid without any fancy clickable GUI, homelab is a place for us to beat our fear.
